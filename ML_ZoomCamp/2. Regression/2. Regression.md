EDA: In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20exploratory%20data%20analysis,and%20other%20data%20visualization%20methods.)

Steps involved in the Validation Framework
 * First draw the samples for train, validation, and test used shuffle method.
 * target variable (msrp) converted into log scale to impove the usability
 * Linear Regrssion: $$ g(X_i) â‰ˆ y_i $$
  $$ X_i = (X_{i1}, X_{i2}, ..... , X_{in}) $$
 * In order to find the weights: the following process has to be done
 * From linear regression
