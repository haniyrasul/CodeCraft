ML Regression:
 * Prepare data and do EDA
 * Use Linear Regression for predicting price
 * Understand the internal of Linear Regression
 * Evaluating the model with RMSE
 * Feature Engineering
 * Regularization
 * Homework

EDA: In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20exploratory%20data%20analysis,and%20other%20data%20visualization%20methods.)

* Simple Linear Regression model created.
  1. Predict the price using numerical columns
  2. Created RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to reduce the error.
  3. Developed feature engineering for categorical variables.
  4. Added regularization, whenever there are duplicate elements, singular matrix causes inverse problem, hence Regularization.
  5. Finally applied the model to predict the price, then convert it into log scale to normal value.
