1.1 Introduction to ML:
 * Consider the Car Price Prediction example:
	 * The ML model learns form data, represented as some 
		 * **Features**: Year, Mileage, Transmission Type. and the 
		 * **Target** variable in this case: **Car's Price** , by extracting patterns from the data (features).
	* The model is given new data (features) about the cars and predict their price (target)
* In summary, <u> <b> ML is a process of extracting patterns from data,</b> which is of two types: </u>
	* features (information about the object)
	* target (property to predict for unseen objects)
* Therefore, new feature values are presented to the mode, and it makes **predictions** from the learned patterns.

1.2 Rules Vs ML:

* Rule-based systems:
	* Rule-based systems rely on predefined rules explicitly set by humans, making decisions based on logical conditions. They are typically easier to interpret and debug, but may struggle with handling complex or dynamic situations

* ML
	* Machine learning systems learn from data, adapting and improving over time. While they excel in handling complexity, they may lack transparency due to their reliance on data-driven patterns.


1.3 Supervised Machine Learning:
$$ g(X) â‰ˆ y $$ $$ g - model, X - features, y - target$$

* Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model is trained on a labelled dataset, meaning each input data point is paired with its corresponding output label. 
* The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, enabling the model to make predictions or decisions on unseen data. During training, the model adjusts its parameters iteratively to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and the true labels
* Most Common Types:
	* Regression
	* Classification
	* Ranking
* Applications:
	* Image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, among others.
